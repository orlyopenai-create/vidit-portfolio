## What We're Building

Single-page scrolling portfolio website for **Vidit Dugar** — targeting VC partners at early-stage, consumer-focused Indian funds. Goal: communicate investment track record, philosophy, and operator background within 90 seconds of scrolling.

**PRD:** `vidit_dugar_portfolio_PRD.md` (in project root) — fully detailed, read this for all copy/design specs.

## Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion |
| Tailwind | **v4** — completely different config: `@import "tailwindcss"` + `@theme {}` in CSS. No `tailwind.config.js`. |
| Fonts | `next/font/google` only — never `<link>` tags (causes CLS). Playfair Display (headings), DM Sans (body), DM Mono (numbers) |
| Animations | `LazyMotion` + `domAnimation` at app root — never full Framer bundle. All animated components are `'use client'` leaf wrappers only. |
| Dark theme | `background-color: #0D0D0D` on `html, body` in `globals.css` — must be pre-JS to prevent flash |
| Logo images | Stored in `/public/logos/` as local files, rendered with plain `<img>` tags — no `next/image` for logos |
| Media assets | Photos/videos hosted on Cloudflare, not `/public/`. Logo grid: local files. |
| Deployment | Vercel (CI on main branch) |
| Content | All static in `lib/data/*.ts` — no CMS, no database |

---

## Design Spec (Quick Reference)

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Background | `#0D0D0D` |
| Accent (gold) | `#C8922A` |
| Text | Warm off-white |
| Heading font | Playfair Display |
| Body font | DM Sans |
| Numbers font | DM Mono |
| Style | Refined editorial dark — The Economist × investment firm. NO gradients, NO Inter, NO SaaS look |

---

## Site Sections (in scroll order)

1. **Hero** — Name, `Investor. Operator. Builder.`, subline, headshot placeholder, 4 animated stats
2. **About / The Story** — ~250-word narrative prose + pull quote
3. **Investment Philosophy** — 3 numbered pillars
4. **The Barbershop Fund** — Fund stats, standout investments table (5 co's), 25-company logo grid
5. **Featured Investment: Kilrr** — ~300-word case study, "we/the fund" framing throughout
6. **Writing & Media** — LinkedIn post cards + photo gallery (placeholder-first)
7. **Career Timeline** — 5 entries reverse chronological
8. **Beyond Work** — Story of My Life + interests
9. **Contact / Footer** — Email, LinkedIn, closing line, no contact form

---

## Critical Constraints

- **"We/the fund" framing** in all investment copy — never "I" for investment decisions (Shantanu Deshpande was final decision-maker at Barbershop Fund)
- **No contact form** — email mailto link only
- **No dark/light toggle** — committed dark theme
- **Placeholder-first** — site must be fully buildable without real headshot, photos, LinkedIn posts, or logos
- **Lighthouse 90+** — architecture decisions (SSR, LazyMotion, next/font) all serve this goal
- **Logo IP** — 25 portfolio logos displayed in monochrome white; hover reveals color. Confirm stealth companies with Vidit before live

---

## Pending Content Assets (Vidit to Supply)

- [ ] Headshot (800×800px min)
- [ ] LinkedIn posts — 6–8 best (text + URL)
- [ ] Photos: Barbershop podcast, Orly/exhibitions, Nomura London, Story of My Life
- [ ] Fund deck PDF (`Barbershop_Fund_-_Investment_summary_Q3_FY26.pdf`) — for logo extraction
- [ ] Logo IP confirmation for any stealth portfolio companies
- [ ] Domain preference: `vidit.vc` vs `viditdugar.com`
